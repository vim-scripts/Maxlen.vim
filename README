When you want to know the longest line in the buffered text file, Please try this script.
It makes the cursor jumped on the longest line and also marks the top five long lines with the message like "Marked a=lin.54(col.78), b=36(77), c=56(77), d=20(76), e=55(76)".
This is my first vim scripting and I've enjoyed it a lot.
